# Fluttershy

Low level game-engine-like interface for flutter games. All this does is exposing Game class which you can extend and override setup, update, event, render and destroy methods to do your own thing.

I am working on more complete engine in another repository. I wanted to leave this separate because it could be useful if you just want to do some interactive canvas widget which does not require whole engine library with sprite rendering, etc...
